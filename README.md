# libftp

libftp is a crate implementing the file transfer protocol (FTP) in Rust. The crate currently features a parser, serializer and proxy modules.

## Future Plans
- [ ] FTP client.
- [ ] FTP server.

## About The Project

This is a passion project of mine that I want to grow and I make a viable FTP utilities crate.
Feel free to point out bugs, performance issues, difficult to use APIs, request missing features and contribute your own code!

All protocol considerations in this project follow RFC 959 and later FTP RFCs such as: 2228, 2640, 2773, 3659, 5797, 7151.
