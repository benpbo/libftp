libftp is a crate implementing the file transfer protocol (FTP) in Rust. The crate currently features a parser, serializer and proxy modules.

## Future Plans

## Contributing

Feel free to point out bugs, performance issues, difficult to use APIs, request missing features and contribute your own code! This is a passion project of mine that I want to grow and I make a viable FTP utilities crate.
